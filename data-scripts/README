German Dictionaries:
https://github.com/hermitdave/FrequencyWords/tree/master/content/2018/de

The C/C++ port zxcvbn-cpp needs to use ASCII-only dictionaries.
However, the German dictionary files are Unicode-UTF8 encoded files and many words contain non-ASCII characters.

German 50K common words dictionary with occurrences (frequency list):

German first names dictionary (not used):

German last names dictionary (not used):

The German dictionary de.txt was produced as an ASCII-only text file from de_50k.txt.
The script data-scripts/non-ascii-conv.sh was run on it, but a second manual cleaning was needed to remove some non-German words still containing non-ASCII characters.

The final ASCII-only text file de.txt was added to the dictionaries processed by the python script data-scripts/build_frequency_lists.py
Finally, the script data-scripts/update-frequency-lists.sh was run to generate the CPP files:

zxcvbn-cpp/native-src/zxcvbn/_frequency_lists.cpp
zxcvbn-cpp/native-src/zxcvbn/_frequency_lists.hpp
zxcvbn-cpp/native-src/zxcvbn/adjacency_graphs.cpp
zxcvbn-cpp/native-src/zxcvbn/adjacency_graphs.hpp
